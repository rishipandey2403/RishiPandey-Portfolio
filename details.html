          I am Rishi Pandey, a 25-year-old Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Data Scientist with a passion for transforming raw data into strategic insights.
          My journey began with a strong academic foundation—a PGDM in Big Data Analytics from Goa Institute of Management—where I mastered the art of analytics,
          and earned accolades for innovative problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Deloitte, as a Consultant (Assistant Manager), I spearheaded transformative projects for global giants like Unilever UK,
          engineering data-driven solutions on Azure that boosted product performance by <span class="highlight">40%</span> and improved operational efficiency significantly.

        <p>
          In my most recent six-month stint (April–October 2025) as a Reporting Insights & Operations Intern at American Express, I was entrusted with
          delivering actionable insights for one of the world’s most admired financial institutions. At Amex, I navigated through complex data sets,
          built robust reports, and influenced strategy by translating granular data into clear, impactful narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The role demanded a blend of technical acumen and business savvy—requiring expertise in Hive, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI—
          all of which I employed to drive forward-thinking initiatives that enhanced sales performance and operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Amex, the mantra was "You Lead the Way. We’ve Got Your Back." This ethos fueled my determination to excel,
          ensuring that every report and insight I delivered was aligned with the company's commitment to excellence.

        <p>
          My vision is simple yet bold: to harness the power of data to shape a world where decisions are informed, precise, and transformative.
          I aspire to join top-tier firms—be it MAANG, Fortune 500 companies, or global financial institutions—where my expertise in analytics
          can drive innovative solutions and create lasting impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that every dataset has a story, and my goal is to tell those stories in ways that not only inform but inspire action.
          Together, we can transform the way businesses understand and utilize data to achieve unprecedented growth and efficiency.
