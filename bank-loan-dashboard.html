    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <section class="project-overview">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Bank Loan Dashboard project is an interactive Power BI solution designed to provide comprehensive insights into bank loan data. 
        It leverages advanced data analytics techniques to assess loan performance, risk factors, and overall financial trends, enabling financial institutions to make data-driven decisions.

    <!-- Problem Statement -->
    <section class="problem-statement">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Banks and financial institutions require a real-time, data-driven approach to understand the dynamics of loan applications and approvals. 
        Traditional reporting methods often fail to provide actionable insights into risk factors, customer segmentation, and performance metrics, 
        leading to sub-optimal decision-making.

    <!-- Objectives -->
    <section class="objectives">
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amounts, and default rates.</li>
        <li>Identify high-risk borrower segments and trends over time.</li>
        <li>Enhance decision-making through interactive, drill-down reports.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Methodology -->
    <section class="methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The project involves multiple stages of data processing and visualization:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Collection:</strong> The primary dataset, <em>financial_loan.csv</em>, was used to gather loan information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Data was cleaned and transformed using SQL queries (refer to <em>Queries.sql</em> and <em>Queries.docx</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Domain Knowledge:</strong> Supporting documents (<em>Domain Knowledge Doc.docx</em> and <em>Terminologies in Data.docx</em>) provided insights into key financial metrics and loan dynamics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Visualization:</strong> The prepared data was visualized in Power BI (using the <em>Bank_Loan_Dashboard.pbix</em> file) to create interactive dashboards and reports.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
