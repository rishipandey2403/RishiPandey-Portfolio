        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Story: From Cricket Fan to Sports Analyst</h2>
            <p>
                I’ve followed the IPL like most of us do – emotionally. But as a data analyst, I wanted to go beyond
                “CSK vs GT banter” and actually <strong>quantify performance across teams, seasons, and players</strong>.
                This project is my attempt to bring a structured, analytics-first lens to IPL history using Power BI.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal was to design a dashboard where a casual fan, a fantasy league player, or even a sports
                strategist could quickly answer:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which team has been the most consistent across seasons?</li>
                <li>How do Orange &amp; Purple Cap winners influence team results?</li>
                <li>What does a “championship season” look like in numbers?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The result is an <strong>interactive IPL Analytics Dashboard (2008–2025)</strong> that combines
                team standings, batting &amp; bowling stats, and season-wise trends into a single view.

                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        With 15+ seasons of IPL data, it’s hard to see patterns just by looking at tables or scorecards.
                        Every season has new teams, auctions, and player dynamics. Fans and analysts need a way to
                        <strong>cut through the noise</strong> and understand performance at a macro level:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Which teams dominate the league table and why?</li>
                        <li>How do batting and bowling awards correlate with team success?</li>
                        <li>What are the high-scoring seasons and formats of play?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Build a <strong>single-page IPL overview</strong> for quick storytelling.</li>
                        <li>Track <strong>Champions, Runners-up, total 4s/6s, centuries</strong> and matches.</li>
                        <li>Highlight <strong>Orange Cap &amp; Purple Cap winners</strong> with team context.</li>
                        <li>Show a <strong>dynamic points table</strong> that updates with season selection.</li>
                        <li>Design the page so it feels like a broadcast-style sports panel, but powered by data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- ===== DATA & MODEL ===== -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Dataset & Modelling Approach</h2>
            <p>
                I used season-wise IPL match and player statistics (batting, bowling and team results) and modelled it in Power BI
                as a clean semantic layer:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Match-level table</strong> – season, teams, venue, result, total 4s, 6s, centuries, winning margin.</li>
                <li><strong>Team table</strong> – team names, logos, abbreviations (used in points table visual).</li>
                <li><strong>Player stats table</strong> – season-wise runs, wickets, 4s and 6s for Orange/Purple Cap logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Season dimension</strong> – used as the main slicer for toggling 2008–2025 views.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In Power BI, I used relationships on <strong>Season</strong> and <strong>Team</strong>, and created
                DAX measures for aggregate KPIs (total 4s, total 6s, matches, centuries, points, etc.) so the entire
                page responds to a single <strong>Season</strong> dropdown.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- ===== DASHBOARD WALKTHROUGH ===== -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Dashboard Walkthrough</h2>

            <h3>🏆 Title Bar & Season Context</h3>
            <p>
                The top band, labelled <strong>“IPL Analysis (2008–2025)”</strong>, sets the context with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Champions</strong> – e.g., Chennai Super Kings.</li>
                <li><strong>Runners-up</strong> – e.g., Gujarat Titans.</li>
                <li><strong>Season selector</strong> – dropdown to switch between seasons.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>📌 Core KPIs</h3>
            <p>Directly under the header I show summary tiles for the selected season:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total 6s hit across all matches.</li>
                <li>Total 4s hit.</li>
                <li>Total matches played.</li>
                <li>Total teams participating.</li>
                <li>Number of centuries scored.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>👑 Player Spotlight Cards</h3>
            <p>
                The middle section focuses on star performers with IPL-style “cap” tiles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orange Cap</strong> – player name, total runs, franchise.</li>
                <li><strong>Purple Cap</strong> – bowler, total wickets, franchise.</li>
                <li><strong>Top 4s</strong> and <strong>Top 6s</strong> – aggressive batters with boundary count.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These visuals make it easy to see <strong>who carried the batting and bowling load</strong> for each season.
            </p>

            <h3>📊 Points Table</h3>
            <p>
                On the right side, a <strong>points table visual</strong> (matrix/table) tracks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team logo and name.</li>
                <li>Matches played, won, lost, and no-result.</li>
                <li>Ties and final points.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This reflects the official IPL points structure and allows a quick sense of
                <strong>who dominated the league stage</strong>.
            </p>

        <!-- ===== INSIGHTS & TAKEAWAYS ===== -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Key Insights & Patterns</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Run-heavy seasons:</strong> Some seasons clearly stand out with significantly higher counts
                    of total 4s and 6s, hinting at flatter pitches and power-hitting eras.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Champion consistency:</strong> Teams like Chennai Super Kings frequently appear near the
                    top of the points table even in seasons they don’t win, underscoring squad depth and strategy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Orange/Purple Cap impact:</strong> In many seasons, the team with the Orange or Purple Cap
                    winner also finishes in the top 2–3 positions, showing how star performance correlates with
                    overall team success.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Competitive balance:</strong> The spread of points often shows tightly packed mid-tables,
                    reflecting a highly competitive league where small margins decide playoff spots.
                </li>
            </ul>
