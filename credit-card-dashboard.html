      <h2>🎭 Storyline: Cracking the Credit Card Code</h2>
      <p>
        In the buzzing world of financial transactions, an unexplained drop in card usage jolted the leadership of a top bank. Transactions were up in some states, down in others, and credit limits seemed mysteriously stagnant. This wasn't just a data dip — it was a *plot twist*. Enter our Data Detective: armed with Power BI and a mountain of credit card data.
      </p>

      <p>
        This dashboard was designed to bring complete visibility into the **Credit Card lifecycle** — from issuance to limits, customer activity, and regional insights. With crisp KPIs, slicers, and interactive visuals, the project provided:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>📊 Segmented overview of customers by <strong>age, gender, and credit limit</strong></li>
        <li>📍 Geo-based performance of credit cards by state</li>
        <li>💰 Deep-dive into credit limit distributions & card types</li>
        <li>🕵️‍♂️ Strategic indicators for identifying underutilized segments</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        What started as a messy dataset turned into a crystal-clear visual story. With this dashboard, leadership was able to make informed decisions, personalize campaigns, and forecast user behavior with confidence.
